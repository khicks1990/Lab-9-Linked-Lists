Implement a class that maintains a list of the top 10 performers in a video game. An entry on the list consists of a name and score, and the list is kept sorted in descending order of scores. Here is an example of such a list when it has only four elements.

Spike 120
Whiz 105
G-Man 99
JediMaster 95

Use a class based on linked lists. The class should have an int getPosition(GameStat stat), and a void insert (String name, int score) method that adds a name and a score pair to the list. The  method puts the entry in the proper position so that the list stays sorted by score. The list should have a maximum size of 10. After the list has 10 elements, an attempt to add a name with a score that is less than or equal to the minimum score on the list is ignored, and adding a score that is greater than the minimum score causes an entry with the minimum score to be dropped from the list.
Test the score with a graphical user interface similar to LinkedList1Demo. The graphical interface should support a single command of the form

insert name score

An example of such a command is “insert Whiz 105.”

You will need to use insert to populate the list to test.

Implement your code in Main.java file starting on line 122.
